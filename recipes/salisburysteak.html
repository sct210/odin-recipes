        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>1 Package of ground turkey </li>
                <li>1 Package of knorr gravy mix</li>
                <li>Salt</li> 
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Onion powder</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Light olive oil</li>
                
            </ul>
                
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                
                <li>In a large bowl mix ground turkey with 1/2 teaspoon each of black pepper, salt, garlic powder and onion powder. Mix this all together and make patties ( you should be able to make 4 oval patties about 1 inch thick.</li>
                <li>In a nonstick pan put about a teaspoon of light olive oil and fry the 4 patties about 3-5 mins on each side on medium heat. You'll need to watch it so it doesn't burn. If you think it's cooking too fast adjust the heat.</li>
                <li>Prep the gravy. Put the mix in a bowl with the amount of water per the instruction. Mix it well then add it to the pan with the steaks. Let this simmer for 5-10 mins making sure you stir the liquid every so often so you don't get big lumps. Once the gravy is cooked let it continue to simmer so it cooks the steaks all the way thru. Entire cooking time may take 30
                    mins or so. If you have a cover for the pan even better.</li>
            
            </ol>
