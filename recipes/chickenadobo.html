        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish that is very <em>savory</em> and goes perfectly with a large platter of rice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li> Soy sauce </li>
                <li> Apple cider vinegar </li>
                <li> Garlic</li>
                <li> Onions</li>
                <li> Fresh ginger (peeled and sliced)</li>
                <li> Sugar</li>
                <li> Red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                <li> Black pepper</li>
                
            </ul>
                
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                
                <li>Wash and rinse the chicken thighs</li>
                <li>In a large pot sautée 2 garlic cloves and half of a medium onion chopped. Sautée for about 3 mins until the onions get soft. Stove should be medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/8 cup of vinegar. Add 4-6 sliced ginger and 2 tablespoon of sugar and black pepper and red pepper flakes to taste. Let it simmer for 5 mins. This is when you want to adjust the flavour. See if you need more soy sauce or vinegar or sugar. Depends how you like it. If it's too salty add some water. Once you're
                    satisfied with the flavour get the sauce to almost a boil and then add the chicken. Once you add the chicken you can't taste the sauce until the chicken is fully cooked. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. In about 5 mins turn or mix the chicken donut get last coated on both sides. Simmer for another 15 mins then enjoy with rice. You have to make sure when you simmer there's a bit of steam else the chicken won't cook all the way thru.</li>
                <li>If you want more sauce add more soy sauce, vinegar and water.</li>
            
            </ol>
